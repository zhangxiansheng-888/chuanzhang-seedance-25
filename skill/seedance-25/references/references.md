# Multimodal reference control

> 船长AI视界整理与维护

Load `capabilities.md` before quoting input ceilings.

## Assign one authority per dimension

Create a compact map before prompt prose:

| Dimension | Possible owner |
|---|---|
| Identity and costume | image or canonical character sheet |
| First/final visual state | first/last-frame image |
| Motion/blocking | video |
| Camera path and pacing | video or text plan |
| Environment | image, video, or text—but choose one winner |
| Voice/timbre | authorized audio |
| Music/tempo | audio |
| Story timing | timestamp script |
| Style/material treatment | image or text art direction |

No dimension may have two owners. One asset may own several compatible dimensions. Remove any asset that owns nothing.

## Reference declaration pattern

`@图片1控制角色A的脸、发型与服装；@图片2控制场景；@视频1仅控制动作节奏与运镜，不迁移其中人物、服装、场景、文字和Logo；@音频1控制角色A的授权音色；时间轴控制事件发生时机。`

Preserve every `@` tag byte-for-byte. Never translate, renumber, respell, or silently replace it.

## Choose references for stability

- Prefer 1–5 clear video/audio subjects and 1–8 image subjects even though 2.5 accepts more.
- Use clean silhouettes, uncluttered motion, and a stable camera for motion donors.
- Prefer separate images for different views instead of one dense multi-view collage when many subjects are involved.
- Keep the identity reference visually unambiguous: one character, readable face, consistent costume, no competing look-alikes.
- Mute a video donor when its audio should not own timing.

## 2.5 reference workflows

### Audio-only generation

State what the audio controls—voice, rhythm, mood, ambience, or event timing—and build the visuals in text. Do not treat possession of audio as proof of voice or music rights.

### Creative transfer

Transfer deeper production logic only when named: emotion curve, camera language, comedy timing, commercial concept, or transition pattern. Continue to exclude donor identity, environment, logo, voice, and protected material unless authorized.

### Several people

Give each character:

- a unique identity source or distinct physical description;
- a stable screen position or role;
- separate dialogue/voice ownership;
- separate action responsibility.

State which characters may touch or cross. For crowded action, split the scene or reduce simultaneous interactions before adding more adjectives.

### Multi-panel storyboard

The storyboard owns composition, shot order, framing, and action placement—not finished identity or rendering unless explicitly assigned. Use `white-model-storyboard.md` for the full workflow.

## Rights and leakage check

Use owned, licensed, public-domain, or clearly authorized assets. For an unclear donor, transfer broad motion, pacing, mood, or camera function rather than likeness, voice, logos, or a recognizable protected design.
